Welcome to the Japanese Garden in Pune. 
<br>One of its kinds, the Pune Okayama Friendship Garden is the largest Japanese garden outside of Japan
<br> This is the biggest garden of Japanese style out of Japan, in Asia. 
<br>The idea of recreating the original Japanese garden in Pune was, of course, 
<br>inspired from the 300-year old Okayama Korakuen Garden developed by Ikeda Royal family in the 12 specious hectares in Okayama.</p>
