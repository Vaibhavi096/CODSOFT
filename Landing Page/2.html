<p>Sarasbaug is a major landmark in the city of Pune in India.<br>
     The place where the park now stands was once occupied by a small lake. 
<br>However, the lake dried up and was later developed into Sarasbaug. The whole 25-acre (10 ha) complex is known as Sarasbaug. 
<br>The Ganesh temple in Saras Baug is also known as Talyatla Ganapati (in Marathi:तळ्यातला गणपती ) which translates as the Ganapati of the lake.
