<p>Built in 1732, it was the great seat of the Peshwas of the Maratha Empire until 1818.
     <br>Following the rise of the Maratha Empire, the palace became the center of Indian politics in the 18th century.
<br>The fort itself was largely destroyed in 1828 by an unexplained fire, but the surviving structures are now maintained as a tourist site.</p>
